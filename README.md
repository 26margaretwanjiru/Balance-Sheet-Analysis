# Balance Sheet Analysis

# 1.0 Background and Introduction

According to the cfainstitute(https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/understanding-balance-sheets), the balance sheet provides information on a company’s resources (assets) and its sources of capital (equity and liabilities/debt). This information helps an analyst assess a company’s ability to pay for its near-term operating needs, meet future debt obligations, and make distributions to owners. The basic equation underlying the balance sheet is Assets = Liabilities + Equity.

Financial modeling prep (https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/education/the-basics-of-financial-statement-analysis) further states that understanding and analyzing a company's financial statements is an essential skill to make investment decisions. By doing a financial statement analysis, you'll be able to recognize the impact of all business activities on the top and bottom line (revenue, costs, and profit).

# 4.0 Description of the Financial Ratios

a. Current Ratio - This is the difference between current assets and current liabilities. The higher the ratio is, the more capable you are of paying off your debts.A current ratio of 1.0 or greater is considered acceptable for most businesses.

b. Quick Ratio - This is the ratio between quickly available or liquid assets and current liabilities.Whereas the quick ratio only includes a company's most highly liquid assets, like cash, the current ratio factors in all of a company's current assets — including those that may not be as easy to convert into cash, such as inventory. Both ratios compare assets against the business's current liabilities.

c. Debt to Equity Ratio - Shows how much debt a company has compared to its equity. What counts as a “good” debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio will depend on the nature of the business and its industry. Generally speaking, a debt to equity ratio below 1 would be seen as relatively safe, whereas values of 2 or higher might be considered risky.

d. Debt to Assets Ratio - Shows the degree to which a company's operations are funded by debt. A debt to assets ratio of 0.8 means that four-fifth of the business is owned by creditors and one-fifth by shareholders.

e. Net debt - Reflects a company's ability to meet all of its obligations simultaneously using only those assets that are easily liquidated.

f. Return on Assets Ratio - Indicates how profitable a company is in relation to its total assets i.e. how well a company is generating profits from its total assets which is important when investing.

g. Return on Equity Ratio - A gauge of a corporation's profitability and how efficiently it generates those profits. The higher the ROE, the better a company is at converting its equity financing into profits.

h. Gross Profit Margin - Gross margin represents the portion of each dollar your business retains. For example, if your gross margin is 30%, you are earning $0.30 for each dollar of revenue you earn.
