# Balance Sheet Analysis

# Background and Introduction

According to the cfainstitute(https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/understanding-balance-sheets), the balance sheet provides information on a company’s resources (assets) and its sources of capital (equity and liabilities/debt). This information helps an analyst assess a company’s ability to pay for its near-term operating needs, meet future debt obligations, and make distributions to owners. The basic equation underlying the balance sheet is Assets = Liabilities + Equity.

Financial modeling prep (https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/education/the-basics-of-financial-statement-analysis) further states that understanding and analyzing a company's financial statements is an essential skill to make investment decisions. By doing a financial statement analysis, you'll be able to recognize the impact of all business activities on the top and bottom line (revenue, costs, and profit).
